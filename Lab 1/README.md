# [Lab 1](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2018/labs/lab1/)

First setup before entry to exercises (choose 1 option):
1. Setup a local athena machine:
    + Require: Ubuntu 14.04 32bit.
    + Follow the tutorial to install debathena standard metapackage.
        + [Tutorial for setup](https://kb.mit.edu/confluence/pages/viewpage.action;jsessionid=C41777EAE7A587A2A0C394246BAF6454?pageId=152594763).
        + [Ubuntu 14.04 iso file](https://releases.ubuntu.com/14.04/ubuntu-14.04.6-desktop-i386.iso).
    + And then follow the lab tutorial to continue setup software environment.
2. Follow this [guide](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2018/tools.html) and install all tools needed. (I take this)

After setup environment, git clone the job into lab by `git clone https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2018/jos.git lab` and start the exercises.
